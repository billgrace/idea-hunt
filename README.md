Initially just a set of colored areas in the browser window to implement responsiveness to orientation, window size and mobile device variations.

Next some simple renderings in the three "camera" areas. As a minimal world: one topic horizon, one square puck as a launcher base, one horizontal cylinder as a launcher and one sphere as a self. One overhead directional light.
Appearance: horizon = GrandCanyon.jpg, puck = green, cylinder = red, sphere = yellow.
Size: horizon = 1,600 wide x 900 high, puck = 200 wide/long, 50 high, cylinder = 25 radius, 150 length, sphere = 25 radius.

I find the set of names "SelfCam", "NavCam" and "VanityCam" a bit misleading - better to change it to "ViewCam", "NavCam" and "SelfCam".
